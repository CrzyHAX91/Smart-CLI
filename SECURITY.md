## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SmartCLI seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps to responsibly disclose it:

1. **Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Instead, please report them via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key (available upon request).

3. Please include the following information in your report:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

4. Allow up to 48 hours for an initial response to your report. We will endeavor to keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a pull request.

## Security Update Process

1. The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler.
2. The problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for all supported releases.
5. New versions are released and notifications are sent out.

## Security-Related Configuration

- We use HTTPS/SSL for all communications.
- We use secure hashing algorithms for storing passwords.
- We implement rate limiting on authentication attempts.
- We use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- We sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

## Known Security Gaps & Future Enhancements

- We are working on implementing two-factor authentication.
- We plan to add support for security keys in the next major release.
- We are in the process of conducting a third-party security audit.

Thank you for helping keep SmartCLI and its users safe!
