# Security Training Guide

## Overview
This guide provides essential security training information for team members working on this project. Regular review of these practices is recommended.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Dependency Management
- Always review dependencies before adding them to the project
- Keep dependencies up to date using `npm audit` and Dependabot alerts
- Understand the security implications of each dependency
- Review the SECURITY.md file for our dependency management policies

### 2. Code Security
- Never commit sensitive information (tokens, passwords, keys)
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive details

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure password hashing
- Implement proper access controls
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper JWT handling if used

### 4. Regular Security Tasks
- Review CodeQL analysis reports
- Address Dependabot alerts promptly
- Participate in code reviews with security focus
- Run regular security audits
- Update security documentation as needed

### 5. Incident Response
- Know the security incident reporting process
- Understand the vulnerability disclosure policy
- Be familiar with the incident response plan
- Know who to contact in case of security incidents

## Security Tools

### 1. CodeQL
- Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities
- Review CodeQL alerts in GitHub Security tab
- Understand common vulnerability patterns
- Fix identified issues promptly

### 2. Dependabot
- Review Dependabot alerts regularly
- Understand the impact of dependency updates
- Test thoroughly before merging updates
- Keep track of dependency update history

### 3. npm audit
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Understand severity levels
- Address high-severity issues immediately
- Document any necessary vulnerability exceptions
