2. Email us at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with details of the vulnerability.
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations or workarounds

We commit to the following:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

- Keep you informed about the progress of the fix.
- Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.

## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

1. **Dependabot Integration**: We use GitHub's Dependabot to automatically check for outdated or insecure dependencies. It creates pull requests to update these dependencies, ensuring we're always using the most secure versions.

2. **Strict Version Control**: Our `package.json` file includes strict version controls and overrides to prevent the use of known vulnerable dependency versions.

3. **Regular Security Audits**: We perform regular security audits using `npm audit` and address any found vulnerabilities promptly.

4. **Continuous Integration**: Our CI pipeline includes security checks to prevent the introduction of known vulnerabilities.

5. **Code Review Process**: All code changes undergo a thorough review process that includes security considerations.

## Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to this project, please follow these security best practices:

1. Keep all dependencies up to date.
2. Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
3. Use environment variables for sensitive information, never hard-code secrets.
4. Follow the principle of least privilege when implementing new features.
5. Write unit tests for security-critical code paths.

By working together, we can ensure the security and integrity of this project. Thank you for your commitment to security!
